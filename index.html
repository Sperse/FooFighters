<h1> Who are the Foo Fighters? </h1>
<p>Foo Fighters is an American rock band, formed in Seattle in 1994. It was founded by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as a one-man project following the death of Kurt Cobain and the resulting dissolution of his previous band. The group got its name from the UFOs that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II, which were known collectively as foo fighters.

Over the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album. The band's seventh studio album, Wasting Light, produced by Butch Vig was released in 2011, in which Smear returned as a full member. As of May 2014, the band's seven albums have sold a combined 11.1 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The band's eighth studio album, Sonic Highways, and their second recorded with Butch Vig, was released in November 2014.</p>
